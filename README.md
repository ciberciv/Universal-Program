# Universal-Program
Universal Program, in Python, (Mathematical) Logic project, Mathematics Degree (UMA, Spain)

The goal of this project is to simulate a universal program u(n, k, m), that is, given a number n that encodes a program, k the length of a k-uple and m a k-uple (m_1, ..., m_k), then u(n, k, m) = r, where r is the final computation done by the program n. If any of the premises isn't fulfilled, then u(n, k, m) is not defined (so it must return an error)

TODO:
- Check if m actually encodes a k-uple.
- Run the program n with starting registers m if every condition is met.

DONE:
- Check if n actually encodes a program.
- Translation from prime to number of register/state to make it easier to read.

CD;PW (Could Do; Probably Won't):
- Implement a better prime factorization algorithm

Why don't do those things?
Because time gets in the way. Maybe one day I'll do it, but probably not for presentation day
